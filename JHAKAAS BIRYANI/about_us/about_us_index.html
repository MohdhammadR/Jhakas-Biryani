            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Our journey was started with a vision to cater all type of events single handedly without compromising on quality at any cost. <br><br> We started the business with a very small shop in 1999 and could only offer biryani’s takeaway. With the passage of time we received an exponential growth and the taste gone viral in the area. <br><br> In 2010 we decided to expand and we made a small dine-in area. By the grace of ALLAH Almighty from 2015 we started to be counted in the top Biryani centers of Karachi as customers started waiting in lines to satisfy their tastebuds. Then in 2018 we started to cater all types of catering events from corporate gatherings to wedding events on our own. <br><br> The hard work of our employees and love of our customers helped us to grow drastically and we opened a new franchise in 2024.</p>
